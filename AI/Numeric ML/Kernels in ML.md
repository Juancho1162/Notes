##### **Objectives**
- Understand non-linear separability.
- Understand the fundamentals of kernel trick from a computational point of view.
- Know the math behind the kernel trick.
- Learn how to define the kernels in order to be able to transform datasets with non-linear separability.

#### Mathematical Definition of Kernel
Let $X_0$ and $X_1$ be two sets of points in an n-dimensional Euclidean space. Then $X_0$ and $X_1$ are linearly separable if there exist ($n+1$) real numbers ($w_1, w_2, ..., w_n, k$) such that every point
