#### 1.1 AI: Symbolic (declarative) vs Numerical (statistical)
AI has traditionally followed two approaches that have evolved separately:
- **Symbolic Approximations (Declaratives)**: Based on theoretical models of cognitive abilities.
- **Numeric Approximations (Statistical)**: Based on the knowledge that can be extracted from data analysis.

The **numeric approach** "mimic" the most probable thing based on the data that has been used to train the model. This creates a functional and even ethical problem, because if the data contains biases, the model will likely reflect those biases (*this effect is more remarcable in supervised and unsupervised learning than in reinforcement learning*). Still they are very powerful and useful.

The **symbolic approach** does not aim to mimic the most probable actions of humans, instead, these models strive to capture the way humans understand data, offering an interpretable representation of the data's knowledge for humans.

##### **Interesting topics**
**XAI**: Explainable Artificial Intelligence, is a critical area of research within the AI field that focuses on making the decisions and processes of AI systems transparent and understandable to humans. The goal of XAI is to develop techniques and models that allow for clarity on how AI models make their decisions, which is especially important for complex models like deep neural networks (DNNs) that are often considered "black boxes" due to their opaque decision-making processes.
